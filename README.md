# iTunesPodcastSourceFeed
Enter a podcast iTunes URL and receive the podcast RSS feed

# Goal

The goal is to have a static page that allows users to enter a podcast url:

(example: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/update-eye-in-the-sky/id152249110?i=1000375238458&mt=2)

and the window returns:

# Thank You

Thank you to Darian Moody (@djm) for the basic algorithm to work this out. He can be found at: https://github.com/djm/uncover-itunes-rss-bookmarklet

Thank you to Adam Schlitt and his tool Feed Flipper. His was the tool I used all the time as a podcast producer and the idea came from that tool. Feed Flipper was critical to debugging hard problems with clients. Can't thank him enough for building this tool:
